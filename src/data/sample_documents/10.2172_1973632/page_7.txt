Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)
•
Deploying an AI/ML capability for operations requires more than data science
(i.e. data discovery, labeling, and AI/ML model building).
•
Deploying an AI/ML capability requires further engineering & stewardship:
-
Live-streaming / live-batched-streaming data ingestion and transformation
-
Model inference serving
-
Prediction streaming
•
Logging
•
Monitoring / triggering alarms
•
Automating actions
