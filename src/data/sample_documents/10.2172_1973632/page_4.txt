“The Reproducibility Problem” (in AI / ML)
•
“I am able to train a model once, but I / someone else can’t reproduce the
same model weights again.”
Issue Mitigating Best Practice
Some variation expected if training in parallel and on variety of hardware.
Weights are a little different
Check within tolerance.
Weights are so different that model Training is getting stuck in local minima. A variety of training schema and
predictions are very different. hyper parameters and optimizers should be tried.
