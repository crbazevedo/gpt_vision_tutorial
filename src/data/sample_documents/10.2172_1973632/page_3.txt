Why you need a sustainable way of developing, deploying, monitoring, and
servicing ML applications (for accelerators)
•
The only person that knew anything
(cid:15482)
need self-documenting procedures
about application / model / code leaves
•
The “reproducibility problem” in deep
need advanced and
(cid:15482)
learning
automated “bookkeeping”
•
Life-cycle handling: is it still doing the
(cid:15482)
need to automate common updates
right thing? If not, what does an
accelerator operator do at 3 A.M.?
