How do you serve an AI controller model?
•
We could just throw it on the machine and hope for the best!
•
Scary reasons not to do that:
-
Data drift (incoming data is different from what the model was trained to do)
•
[other side: model performs poorly]
-
Stuff stops working and the accelerator operators throw away your “solution”
•
MLOps can help!
-
Ok, so how do I know if this bad stuff happens? Data & performance monitoring! Alarming!
-
What do I do when this happens? Trigger workflows! Automate retraining! Deploy updated
model!
