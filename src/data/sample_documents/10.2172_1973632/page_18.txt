Workflow for MLOps
• Standardized accel. data • Use Common Tools • Interfaces for ML Engineer: • Server with proper
logger & filter. • Model Development System • Getting “live data“ specifications
• Standardized format. • ~MLFlow / hyper p. tune • Setting “actions” • Monitoring services
• Interface for ML Engineer: data • VC: model with references to • Monitoring input, model • Control services
env., data, results predictions/performance
filter. • (Logging services)
• Model Registry
• Dataset Management System • Automate deployment of model
• All data, env., model, and
• Versioning assets from Model Registry
performance assets
• Track derivative datasets
• Metadata
