“The Reproducibility Problem” (in AI / ML)
•
“I am able to train a model once, but I / someone else can’t reproduce the
same model weights again.”
Issue Mitigating Best Practice
Some variation expected if training in parallel and on variety of hardware.
Weights are a little different
Check within tolerance.
Weights are so different that model Training is getting stuck in local minima. A variety of training schema and
predictions are very different. hyper parameters and optimizers should be tried.
As model’s code is version controlled, also version control model’s
Human mishandling, hard to detect
performance so that performance results don’t get mixed up.
Different datasets give different This is to be expected within some tolerance. Just as model code is
weights version controlled, train/val/test datasets should be version controlled.
Works for me, but not for you Environment needs to be version controlled! (Packages and versions)
