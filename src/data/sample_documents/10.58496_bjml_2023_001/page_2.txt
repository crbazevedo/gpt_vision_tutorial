2. TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES
Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without
being explicitly programmed. There are several different types of machine learning techniques that are commonly used [3].
These techniques can be broadly categorized into three main types [4]:
1. Supervised learning : The computer is presented with labeled example inputs and their desired outputs. The goal
is to build a model that learns these input-output mappings so it can predict the output when presented with new
inputs. Examples of supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks,
and support vector machines [3].
2. Unsupervised learning : In this type of learning, the model is provided with inputs but no labeled responses. It
tries to find hidden patterns and relationships in the data on its own. Cluster analysis, anomaly detection, and
association rule learning are examples of commonly used unsupervised learning techniques [4].
3. Reinforcement learning : Here the model learns by interacting dynamically with its environment. The model is
provided feedback in terms of rewards and punishments as it navigates its problem space. It tries maximizing its
cumulative reward through trial and error. Common applications include video games, robotics, and autonomous
driving systems [3].
4. Semi-supervised learning : is a technique that combines supervised and unsupervised machine learning, where
the algorithm is trained on a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data [5]. The goal of
semi-supervised learning is to understand the structure of the distribution of data by exploiting unlabeled data in
addition to labeled data. Typically, labeled datasets are small, expensive, or time-consuming to produce, while
acquiring new unlabeled data is relatively inexpensive and easy [4]. Semi-supervised learning allows for improved
model accuracy by using this readily available unlabeled data, under the assumption that data points with similar
properties are likely of the same class.
In summary, machine learning approaches can be divided into supervised learning for mapping inputs to outputs based on
example input-output pairs, unsupervised learning to uncover patterns and relationships in unlabeled data, and reinforcement
learning for agents interacting with dynamic environments while maximizing rewards. The type of technique selected
depends on factors like data availability, problem complexity, and desired outcomes.
