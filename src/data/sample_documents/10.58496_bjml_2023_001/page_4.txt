4. RECENT WORKS ON REAL-TIME ENGINEERING APPLICATION
4.1 Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS)
computer systems that provide customized instruction and feedback to learners without human intervention [6]. They have
the benefits of providing personalized learning at a student's own pace. Machine learning techniques have emerged as potent
methods to enhance the capabilities of ITS [7]. Some major applications include:
1. Student modeling: Machine learning can construct models to estimate a student's current knowledge, learning styles,
interests etc. Algorithms like Bayesian networks, clustering and reinforcement learning are used to enable adaptive
learning [6].
2. Feedback generation: Natural language processing techniques empower intelligent systems to analyze student
responses and provide tailored, constructive feedback automatically. Sentiment analysis helps determine
appropriate feedback tone [7].
3. Content creation: AI planning and expert systems help generate instructional content dynamically based on the
student's profile and domain models. This allows adjusting the course as per background knowledge and skill gaps
[6].
4. Predictive analytics: Historical student data help train machine learning models to predict outcomes like student
engagement, risk of dropout etc. Teachers can proactively customize interventions [7].

4.2 Machine Learning in Healthcare
Machine learning has emerged as a powerful set of techniques for unlocking insights from healthcare data that can improve
patient outcomes, diagnosis, and treatment planning [8]. Some major applications of machine learning in healthcare include:
1. Precision Medicine: Machine learning analyzes patient data across imaging, genetics, lab tests etc. to offer
personalized risk assessment and treatment recommendations for each individual [9].
2. Medical Imaging Diagnosis: Algorithms can detect anomalies, tumors, lesions etc. in MRI, CT scan and other
medical images. Computer vision techniques enable automated analysis for improved efficiency [10].
3. Patient Risk Analytics : Models predict the risk profile of patients for conditions like diabetes, heart disease etc.
This early assessment allows preventative interventions [8].
4. Drug Discovery: Machine learning expedites analysis of molecular interactions to identify effective drug
compounds. It also aids in tracking drug side-effects once launched [9].
5. Virtual Health Assistants: NLP-powered chatbots serve as virtual nurses to help automate patient queries on
symptoms or medication recommendations at scale for personalized care [10].
