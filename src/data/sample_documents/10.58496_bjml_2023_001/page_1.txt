1. INTRODUCTION
In the digital era, large volumes of data are being generated from real-time engineering applications. This data presents
opportunities to build intelligent systems by applying machine learning techniques to extract insights. Machine learning is
growing in popularity across areas like reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and
supervised learning. [1]
Machine learning allows applications to learn from data instead of needing explicit programming. It is a key technology
enabling automation and enhancement of systems in industry 4.0. The choice of machine learning algorithm impacts
outcomes and depends on factors like the nature of the data and problem being solved. [2]
This text aims to provide a comprehensive study on applying machine learning to real-time engineering applications. It can
serve as a reference guide for industry and academia on how different machine learning techniques can be used to build
effective, data-driven intelligent systems. Both classical machine learning and deep learning methods are considered across
areas including clustering, classification, regression, and more.[2]
In summary, with large volumes of data available, there is great potential for machine learning to enable smart, self-learning
systems across real-time engineering application areas. This text surveys machine learning techniques suited for this purpose
as a reference manual for building these intelligent data-processing applications.
