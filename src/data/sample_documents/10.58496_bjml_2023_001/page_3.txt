3. APPLICATION OF MACHINE LEARNING
Machine learning has become one of the most popular technologies in recent years due to its powerful capabilities and
widespread applications across industries [4]. Some of the major real-world applications of machine learning include:
1. Computer Vision : Machine learning algorithms are used extensively in facial recognition, image classification,
medical imaging analysis, object detection etc. Key techniques include CNNs, RNNs and reinforcement learning
[3].
2. Natural Language Processing : Machine translation, sentiment analysis, text generation and summarization are
some common NLP tasks where machine learning is applied. These techniques rely on analyzing linguistic data to
recognize speech, understand context or generate human readable content.
3. Predictive Analytics : Machine learning models can detect patterns in data to make future outcome predictions
across domains like risk assessment, financial forecasting, healthcare analytics, product recommendation engines
etc [4]. Common models include regression, decision trees and random forests.
4. Robotics and Autonomous Vehicles : The ability for machines to learn representations of the world and make
decisions to navigate environments rely heavily on machine learning. Reinforcement learning trains robotic systems
on how to operate based on dynamic feedback [3].
In summary, machine learning has enabled great leaps in automation and intelligence around interpretability of image/text
data and the ability to make data-driven forecasts and decisions in an adaptive manner. The future applications of ML are
only bound to grow.
